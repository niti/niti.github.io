<p> I've always loved reading. I've included a list of my favorite books and articles that I constantly send to my friends and family. </p>

I've also included links to some of my favorite tweets that have taught me so many incredible lessons. Twitter, my favorite social media platform, has taught me in so many ways in the past and I'd like to share with you the most thought provoking ones.</p>
