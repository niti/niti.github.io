  Hi. I'm Niti. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer at Spotify in New York City.
</p>


<p>
  A few fun facts about me:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal and moved to the U.S. when I was five! 
  </li>

  <li>
  I love sports. I'm a die hard fan of UVa sports. Wahoowa!
  </li>

  <li>
  I ran the New York City Marathon in 2019. 
  </li>

  <li>
  I love working out at Barry's Bootcamp.
  </li>

  <li>
  I love travelling, and always look for an excuse to travel. I've been fortunate to have travelled extensively since graduating from college. I was able to cross off two big bucket list items by visiting Japan, Vietnam, and summiting Mt. Kilimanjaro.

</ul>
