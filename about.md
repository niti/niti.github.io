<p>
  Hi. I'm Niti. I work as a Software Engineer and Machine Learning Engineer at The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) in New York City.
</p>

<p>
  I graduated from the University of Virginia with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering Business in May of 2016.

  I've previously interned at Tesla, and the CIA. I've worked with Microsoft as a Student Partner and Clarifai as a Clarifai Champion.

<p>
   I grew up in Arlington County and am a proud product of Virginia Public Schools.

  A few fun facts about me:
</p>

<ul>

  <li>
  I was born in Kathmandu, Nepal and moved to the U.S. when I was five! 
  </li>

  <li>
  I love sports. I'm a die hard fan of UVa (my undergrad) sports. Wahoowa!
  </li>

  <li>
  I love working out, and am currently obsessed with Barry's Bootcamp.

  I love travelling, and always look for an excuse to travel. I've been fortunate to have travelled extensively since graduating from college. I was able to cross off two big bucket list items by visiting Japan and summiting Mt. Kilimanjaro.
